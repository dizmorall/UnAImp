# What is UnAImp?
UnAImp is a plugin package for musicians with AI built into it. There will be several plugins that will be made for a specific task (For example: plugin for guitar signal processing, plugin for vocal processing).
# How it will work?
The concept of a plugin for guitar processing: it will be a database of all popular amps, pedals and cabinets (speakers), but with one improvement. If you are a musician (For example: you are a guitarist in a cover band) and you need to replicate the sound of some legendary guitarist, you simply give the AI the task "I want to sound like him" either by text (then the AI will rely on its own intuition) or by letting the AI "listen" to an mp3, wave, etc. file with a recording of the processed guitar so that the AI can copy it. It would work like this: you play at least one chord so that the AI can compare its result to the file you uploaded. This way the AI will copy the "sound" you want.

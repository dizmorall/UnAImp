# What is UnAImp?
UnAImp is a plugin package for musicians with AI built into it. There will be several plugins that will be made for a specific task (For example: plugin for guitar signal processing, plugin for vocal processing).
# How it will work?
The concept of a plugin for guitar processing: it will be a database of all popular amps, pedals and cabinets (speakers), but with one improvement. If you are a musician (For example: you are a guitarist in a cover band) and you need to replicate the sound of some legendary guitarist, you simply give the AI the task "I want to sound like him" either by text (then the AI will rely on its own intuition) or by letting the AI "listen" to an mp3, wave, etc. file with a recording of the processed guitar so that the AI can copy it. It would work like this: you play at least one chord so that the AI can compare its result to the file you uploaded. This way the AI will copy the "sound" you want.
# What problems does UnAImp solve?
UnAImp was designed to solve several problems related to the music field. Some of these problems include:
1. Lack of access to information: It is very difficult to find presets that a popular musician uses.
2. Repeating a sound by ear is not easy for humans: The plugin allows guitarists to save time and nerves. 
3. Learning Difficulty: Beginners don't know how to properly tune the sound because they don't know what each button on the amp does, but they have an idol they want to be like. The plugin will allow them to give the AI the sound customization, even if they don't have an mp3 file.
4. Bulky and fragile analog equipment: Tube amps are very fragile and expensive, but have their own charm. Though UnAImp is not the first plugin with amplifiers, it will contribute to the creativity of musicians all over the world.
5. Limited resources and features: Some plugins need quite a powerful processor to output sound in real time, so UnAImp we will try to solve this problem by optimizing the plugin's CPU and system performance. We will also try to minimize the delay that appears when digitizing sound.
